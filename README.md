Hotel information system
This is an information system for hotel management that provide functionalities 
for creating and viewing room reservations. The system record information about rooms, room types, 
guests, and reservations in data base. I used Java for programing language and SQLite DB for data storage.
Interaction with user is implemented using AWT gui tool in Java. 

Running of the program will be executed from the console (command line) with the following command:
java -jar ttp.jar pathToSqliteFile/nameOfTheFile.db
SQLite file doesn't have to already exist.

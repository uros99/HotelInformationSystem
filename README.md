# HotelInformationSystem
Hotel information system <br>
This is an information system for hotel management that provide functionalities <br>
for creating and viewing room reservations. The system record information about rooms, room types, <br>
guests, and reservations in data base. I used Java for programing language and SQLite DB for data storage.<br>
Interaction with user is implemented using AWT gui tool in Java. <br>
<br>
Running of the program will be executed from the console (command line) with the following command:<br>
java -jar ttp.jar pathToSqliteFile/nameOfTheFile.db<br>
SQLite file doesn't have to already exist.<br>
